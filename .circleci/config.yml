Your updated code should look like this:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  snyk: snyk/snyk@1.7.0

jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/dlife
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:12.16.1
      - image: mongo:3.4.4
    steps:
      - checkout
      - restore_cache:
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
      - run:
          name: install-nyc
          command: npm i nyc
      - run:
          name: install-npm-wee
          command: npm install
      - save_cache:
          key: dependency-cache-{{ checksum "package.json" }}
          paths:
            - ./node_modules
      - run:
          name: test
          command: npm test
      - run:
          name: code-coverage
          command: './node_modules/.bin/nyc npm test'
      - store_artifacts:
          path: test-results.xml
          prefix: tests
      - store_artifacts:
          path: coverage
          prefix: coverage
      - store_test_results:
          path: test-results.xml
      - snyk/scan:
          fail-on-issues: false

workflows:
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build:
          context: snyk-security
```

In this updated code, I've added the latest Snyk orb to the CircleCI configuration, added the snyk/scan command after the test and code-coverage steps, and added a context called "snyk-security" to the workflow job that is running the snyk/scan command.
